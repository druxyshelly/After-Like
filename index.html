<h1>Description</h1>
<p>I have reincarnated as the reverse harem game's villainess, the one and only adopted daughter of the ducal Eckart family.</p><br>

<p>But the difficulty just has to be the worst!</p><br>

<p>Everything I do will only lead me to death.</p><br>

<p>I must be paired with one of the main male characters from the heroine's harem before the 'real daughter' of the duke family appears!</p><br>

<p>Two older brothers who always pick a fight with me on every little thing.</p><br>

<p>The insane crown prince whose route will always lead to my death.</p><br>

<p>"I only see the heroine and no one else's wizard, and also her loyal s*ave knight, too!"</p><br>

<p>"First, let's take some of them which I see no hope in, out of the list!"</p><br>

<p>"I didn't know my place up until now. From now on, I will live as quiet as a mouse so you wouldn't care the slightest bit!"</p><br>

<p>But why do their interests in me keep on rising every time I draw the line?!</p><br>
